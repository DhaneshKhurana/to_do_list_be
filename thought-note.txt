Title: To-Do List Back-End Assignment

Summary:
Hi,
My name is Dhanesh Khurana. I have developed the REST API for To-Do list. Now I feel confident enough to develop
REST API for small to medium appliation using javascript and express.
Now I wish to learn the next level as how to design, layout and deploy API securely for big projects.
I have used express.js for advnace routing.

/**Updates**/
-> Now user can choose node-persist and MySql for storing data.
-> Rather than removing or changing earlier code, I have added on more JS file viz: server_sql.js.
-> Anyone can easily switch from node-persist to mysql by simply starting the server_sql.js.
-> The functionality to delete the user has also been added and everything was working flowlessly.


Technical Summary:
This assignment has mainly utilised 3 technlogoies. viz:
    i) Express.js:
        To create the endpoints and routes.
    ii) node-persist:
        To store and retrieve the information.
    iii) MySql:
        To store data relational form.

Thankyou.
